This project is designed to incorporate a selector switch into a van or campervan, specifically to allow users to easily switch between different power sources. The switch will enable the user to select between battery power, solar energy, or a 230V mains supply, depending on what is available and needed at the time. The integration of this selector switch will provide flexibility in energy management, ensuring that the van can operate efficiently in a variety of settings, whether off-grid or connected to external power. The project will prioritize safe wiring and ease of use, making it suitable for DIY installation or professional setup, while improving the overall convenience and sustainability of the van's electrical system.
